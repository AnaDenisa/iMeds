This code connects the server and a RaspberryPi using LoRa protocol and OTAA.
It was part of a larger project, connecting the server and the RaspberryPi on a pill dispenser, that was used by people with mental problems or a complex medication process. When receiving a signal from the server, it starts the servo motors and if the light sensor indicates the pill was not taken, it sends a signal back to the server.
